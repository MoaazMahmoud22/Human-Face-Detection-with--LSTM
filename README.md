## Introduction
Fake news has become a significant issue in the digital age, spreading misinformation and influencing public opinion. This project leverages the power of **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to detect fake news by analyzing the textual content of news articles.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles and can predict whether a given news article is "Real" or "Fake" with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and padding.
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes LSTM layers for sequential text analysis.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: A web interface to input news text and get predictions.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to larger datasets and more complex models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [Fake News Dataset](https://gitlab.com/atlonxp/siit-nlp/-/raw/main/dl-rnn/fake-new-dataset.zip?ref_type=heads&inline=false). It contains one CSV file:
- `fake-news-dataset`: Articles labeled as real and fake news.
- 
dataset contains the following columns:
- `title`: The title of the news article.
- `text`: The content of the news article.
- `label`: The index of the news article.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/MoaazMahmoud22/Human-Face-Detection-with-LSTM.git]
   cd fake-news-detection
